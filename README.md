# Inline everything

![Inline Everything meme](images/meme.jpg)

Recently heard some Android dev said "inline functions ruins all the stacktrack!!!". But for some 
reason I never recall anytime which it is an issue for me, both in terms of personal project, or
my day job. So I'd like to see if it's cause by how they configure their project, or is it a general
issue for everyone.
